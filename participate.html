        Just as Orlando decorated Arden with love notes for Rosalind, we are going to decorate the barn with love notes to James.
        You can create your note beforehand and bring it to hang in the barn, or write your note with supplies provided.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those unable to attend the picnic, you can still participate by sending a note to be hung in the barn. Send notes to:
